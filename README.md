# Scraping and Visualizing Top Anime Data from MyAnimeList

## 1. Project Overview üìå  
This project automates data extraction of top anime from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net) using web scraping techniques. It collects key information such as anime titles, scores, number of members, genres, and studios. The data is then cleaned, visualized, and analyzed to uncover trends in popular anime series.

This project helps anime fans, data enthusiasts, and content curators better understand what makes an anime popular based on rating metrics and member engagement. The final insights can be further visualized using tools like Looker Studio or Tableau.

## 2. Project Description  
The data in this dataset was collected through web scraping using `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas`. The scraper targets the ‚ÄúTop Anime‚Äù list on MyAnimeList to gather relevant information from multiple pages.

### Process Overview:
- **Scraping:** Extract data such as title, score, members, genre, and studios from each page of the Top Anime list.
- **Cleaning:** Remove or handle missing values, convert numeric strings, and separate genre information for analysis.
- **Visualization:** Use pandas and matplotlib to generate insightful visualizations about the most popular anime.
- **Analysis:** Identify patterns and key trends in the most-watched or highest-rated anime series.
